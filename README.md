This repo should allow beginners to play around with the foundations of the card deck without too much knowledge of how things are wired.
A lot of excess files have been trimmed out to reveal a minimal installation. You can compose dashboard apps by following the basic patterns of the starter kit.


## Quick start

* Clone repo with `git clone git@github.com:mattmutt/ngx-card-deck-starter.git`
* Install [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) if necessary, with `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* Grab all tooling and library dependencies `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`, then visit _[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)_ in browser
* _Hungry for more samples_? Graduate to an intermediate [_ngx-card-deck_ seed](https://github.com/mattmutt/ngx-card-deck-seed).



## Platform dependencies versions
* Angular 8
* Clarity 2
* RxJS 6
* Node.js 10+ ( Angular CLI requirements)
* ES2015 ( no need to support IE11 going forward? )

## Server local startup

Run `npm start` *or* for a local development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. The app will automatically reload if you change 
any of the source code files. One sample project is included



## End-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org). One test will verify card deck engine instantiates the sample deck correctly.
